			<h1>Type Conversion</h1>

			<p>Avoid losing floppy disks with important school/work projects on them. Use the web to keep your content so you can access it from anywhere in the world. It's also a quick way to write reminders or notes to yourself. With simple html skills, (the ones you have gained so far) it is easy.</p>

			<p>For instance, let's say you had a HUGE school or work project to complete. Off hand, the easiest way to transfer the documents from your house could be a 3.5" floppy disk. However, there is an alternative. Place your documents, photos, essays, or videos onto your web server and access them from anywhere in the world.</p>

			<p>This is Primer #1 in a series of seven that will calmly introduce you to the very basics of HyperText Mark-up Language. I suggest you take the Primers one at a time over seven days. By the end of the week, you'll easily know enough to create your own HTML home page. No really. You will.
I say that because many people scoff at the notion that they can actually learn this new Internet format. I'm still amazed that the best-selling line of computer books calls its readers "Dummies." And people seem to revel in that title. Some of the smartest people I know love to proclaim themselves "Dummies" regarding every aspect of computers. Strange. I think you'll do a whole lot better at your next cocktail party by handing out your home page address rather than laughing about how dumb you are about the Internet.

			<p>H-T-M-L are initials that stand for HyperText Markup Language (computer people love initials and acronyms -- you'll be talking acronyms ASAP). Let me break it down for you:
Hyper is the opposite of linear. It used to be that computer programs had to move in a linear fashion. This before this, this before this, and so on. HTML does not hold to that pattern and allows the person viewing the World Wide Web page to go anywhere, any time they want.
Text is what you will use. Real, honest to goodness English letters.
Mark up is what you will do. You will write in plain English and then mark up what you wrote. More to come on that in the next Primer.
Language because they needed something that started with "L" to finish HTML and Hypertext Markup Louie didn't flow correctly. Because it's a language, really -- but the language is plain English.</p>
<p>Example:
I am looking to name a document I just wrote on a PC running Windows 3.11 for workgroups. I want to name the document "fred". Thus the document must be named "fred.htm". If it was MAC or Windows 95/98 I would name it "fred.html". Please notice the dot (period) before .htm and .html. And no quotation marks, I just put them in here to set the name apart.</p>
